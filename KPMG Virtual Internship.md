I've compiled my journey through the KPMG Data Analytics Program, showcasing my skills as a  data analyst. This collection highlights my ability to handle complex data and collaborate effectively with KPMG's data analytics team for impactful business results.

# Task 01 - Checking Data Quality
At the start, I carefully checked data accuracy and completeness, using Python tools like Pandas and Numpy. I found and fixed issues, sharing solutions through emails.

# Task 02 - Finding Insights in Data
Moving forward, I used Python to analyze customer data with RFM clustering. This helped me identify valuable customers based on their unique qualities.

# Task 03 - Presenting Data Clearly
In the end, I used Excel/PowerBI to create visual stories that explained data findings and the top 1000 customers the business can target. Though I aimed for an interactive dashboard, I've shared a detailed PDF version due to technical challenges.
